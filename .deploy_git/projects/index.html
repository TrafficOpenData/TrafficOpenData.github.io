		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">This paper aims to design speed advisory profile for connected vehicles (CVs) at an isolated 
signalized intersection in a mixed traffic flow of CVs and human driven vehicles (HDVs). To 
consider the uncertainty of HDVs, we propose the concept of α -percentile trajectory of HDVs. 
We calculate the advisory speed of a CV that follows a HDV, assuming that the HDV moves along 
its α -percentile trajectory. We use dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem. 
Simulation experiments show that, roughly speaking, the benefits of fuel consumption and 
travel time would increase with the increase of inflow rate and market penetration rate (MPR) 
of CVs. The maximum benefits would be achieved at the smallest value of α when the traffic 
flow is undersaturated. However, when the traffic flow is oversaturated, the maximum benefits 
would be achieved at intermediate value of α provided the MPR of CVs is not large. With the 
further increase of the MPR of CVs, the benefits would become not so sensitive to α in the 
range α łe 40%, but significantly decrease with the increase of α when α >40%. Finally, the 
impact of driver heterogeneity, inflow heterogeneity, tracking error and delay has been 
investigated.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Bicycle flow dynamics on wide roads: Experiments and simulation</font></h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">Cycling is a popular and sustainable mode of 
transportation. However, few studies have examined experimental and modeling studies on 
bicycle flow dynamics. In particular, for wide roads, the characteristics of high-density 
regimes in the fundamental diagram have not been well addressed, and the emergence of 
stop-and-go waves has not been fully understood. This study experimentally investigated 
bicycle flow dynamics on wide roads, using two types of 3-m-wide track. Different riding 
behaviors, namely, free riding, following, and overtaking, were analyzed. The bicycle flow 
dynamics were found to be essentially the same on the two tracks: (i) The bicycle flow rate 
remained nearly constant across a wide range of densities, in marked contrast to the 
single-file bicycle flow, which exhibited a unimodal fundamental diagram. By studying the 
weight density of the radial and lateral locations of cyclists, we argue that this behavior 
arises from the formation of more lanes with increase in global density. The newly formed 
lanes prevented the flow rate from decreasing. (ii) When the density exceeded 0.5 bicycles/m2, 
the flow rate began to decrease, and stop-and-go traffic emerged. Based on these behavioral 
observations, we propose an improved heuristic-based model to simulate bicycle flow on roads 
of different radii and explicitly account for the centrifugal effect of bicycles. The 
calibration and validation results demonstrate that the proposed model can reproduce the 
traffic dynamics of bicycle flow.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Automated vehicle-involved traffic flow studies: A survey of
assumptions, models, speculations, and perspectives</h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">Automated vehicles (AVs) are widely considered to 
play a crucial role in future transportation systems because of their speculated capabilities 
in improving road safety, saving energy consumption, reducing vehicle emissions, increasing 
road capacity, and stabilizing traffic. To materialize these widely expected potentials of 
AVs, a sound understanding of AVs’ impacts on traffic flow is essential. Not surprisingly, 
despite the relatively short history of AVs, there have been numerous studies in the 
literature focusing on understanding and modeling various aspects of AV-involved traffic flow 
and significant progresses have already been made. To understand the recent development and 
ultimately inspire new research ideas on this important topic, this survey systematically and 
comprehensively reviews the existing AV-involved traffic flow models with different levels of 
details, and examines the relationship among the design of AV-based driving strategies, the 
management of transportation systems, and the resulting traffic dynamics. The pros and cons of 
the existing models and approaches are critically discussed, and future research directions 
are also provided. </p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Experimental study on properties of lightly congested flow</h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">Congested traffic flow exhibits rather complex 
properties of spatiotemporal evolution, e.g. stop-and-go waves, phantom jams, wide scattering 
of flow-density data, etc. To the best of our knowledge, previous car-following experiments on 
circular tracks only studied heavily congested flow. The experimental study concerning lightly 
congested flow, which exhibits different stability characteristic from heavily congested flow, 
is still lacking. To fill this gap, very recently we conducted a large-scale car-following 
experiment on an 812-meter circumference circuit with densities of 0.049, 0.043 and 0.037 m−1. 
The flow-density relation of the experiment is highly consistent with the empirical one, which 
indicates that the driving behavior in the experiment is similar to that in real traffic. By 
comparing the macroscopic spatiotemporal evolution diagrams in different runs under the same 
global density, we found that the traffic flow exhibits stochastic features with even the same 
initial conditions. We analyzed the car-following behavior and its relation to the macroscopic 
traffic flow evolution. It was found that the indifference region, the sensitivity of drivers, 
and the strength of stochasticity all contribute to the macroscopic traffic flow evolution 
pattern. Specifically, the traffic flow becomes more homogeneous in time-space with the 
expansion of indifference region, the overall decrease of sensitivity and the decrease of 
stochasticity strength. The roles of stochasticity and speed adaptation were further 
investigated. It was found that stronger traffic oscillations correspond to stronger 
stochasticity and speed adaptation. The analysis for competition between the two effects 
indicated that the ratio between speed adaptation effect and stochastic effect grows with the 
increase of the oscillation amplitude. The stochastic effect plays a dominant role in car 
following when the oscillation amplitude is small; its influence wanes and the speed 
adaptation effect grows to outweigh the influence of the stochastic effect as oscillation 
amplitude grows. These findings are expected to improve our understanding of the underlying 
mechanism that produces the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of lightly congested flow and 
the data collected in this study can be used to test traffic models and theories.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Modeling the interactions of pedestrians and cyclists in mixed flow conditions in uni- and bidirectional flows on a shared pedestrian-cycle roa</h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">The mixed flow of pedestrians and cyclists is 
frequently observed on the roads they share, but investigations of the dynamics of this kind 
of mixed flow have been very limited. This study proposes a heuristic-based model to reproduce 
the mixed-flow dynamics of pedestrians and cyclists, and the model is calibrated with an 
experiment on the mixed traffic flow of pedestrians and cyclists. Pedestrians/cyclists were 
asked to walk/ride on a ring-shaped track. In the uni/bidirectional flow scenario, pedestrians 
and cyclists moved in the same/opposite direction. A genetic algorithm was used for parameter 
calibration. The model could reproduce the experimental results well. Under both scenarios, 
pedestrians and cyclists formed their own lanes. The pedestrians walked in the inner lane, and 
cyclists rode in the outer lane in a self-organized process. The widths of the pedestrian lane 
and the cyclist lane were found to be more uniform during bidirectional flow. The pedestrian 
flow rate was higher in the unidirectional flow scenario than in the bidirectional flow 
scenario. In contrast, at low cyclist densities, the cyclist flow rate was essentially the 
same in both scenarios. When the density was high, the cyclist flow rate is higher in the 
unidirectional flow scenario. Sensitivity analyses showed that cyclist speed had little effect 
on the pedestrian flow rate. A higher cyclist speed led to a higher cyclist flow rate at low 
densities, but the cyclist flow rates approached the same value at high cyclist densities. As 
the proportion of pedestrians/cyclists increased, the flow rate of cyclists/pedestrians 
decreased. The simulation results on a straight track were largely consistent with those on a 
ring-shaped track.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Travel cost budget based user equilibrium in a bottleneck model with stochastic capacity</h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">This paper studies a bottleneck model in which the capacity of the bottleneck is constant within a day but changes stochastically 
from day-to-day between a designed value (good condition) and a degraded one (bad condition). The study relates the travel cost variability due to stochastic capacity with 
commuters' departure time choice behaviors. We postulate that commuters acquire the variability of travel cost based on past experiences and factor such variability into their 
departure time choice consideration by minimizing their travel cost budget (TCB), defined as a weighted average of mean travel cost and standard deviation of travel cost. We 
show that the consideration of TCB yields seven possible equilibrium patterns. Closed form solutions to all possible equilibrium patterns and their corresponding parameter 
ranges are derived. The rationality of the patterns has been investigated. Dependence of travel cost and the duration of peak hours on the commuters' risk attitude has also been 
derived in each equilibrium pattern. Finally, numerical studies have been conducted to illustrate the properties.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Morning commute problem with queue-length-dependent bottleneck capacity</h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">When traffic control is demand-responsive, a bottleneck can have a queue-length-dependent capacity. Motivated by this fact, we 
studied the morning commute problem in which the bottleneck capacity increases from s1 to s2 as the queue length exceeds a threshold D1 and decreases back to s1 as the queue 
length reduces and becomes smaller than another threshold D2 (D2 ≤ D1). It has been found that multiple equilibria exist when D2 < D1. Their stability has been preliminarily 
studied via the day-to-day dynamics, and we found it is likely that only the equilibrium state with the lowest cost is stable against large disturbances. In the case where 
D2 = D1, there is no multiple user equilibrium state, and the capacity does not change more than twice. Moreover, there exists a parameter range in which there is no solution 
unless the bottleneck capacity can switch back and forth instantaneously. The policy of opening the shoulder lane on a 2-lane highway is discussed as an application example.</p>
