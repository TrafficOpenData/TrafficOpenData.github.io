## Introduction

<p align="justify">&emsp;The large-circuit experiment was carried out on Nov. 9, 2019, in the test field affiliated to Research Institute of Highway, Ministry of Transport, China. See Fig. 1(a) for a snapshot of the experiment. The trajectories of cars measured by the GPS devices installed on each car are shown in Fig. 1(b). One can see that the radius of the circular track is 129.225 m.</p>

<p align="justify">&emsp;Initially the cars are stopped bumper-to-bumper. When a Run starts, the first car accelerates to ~20 km/h and travels at that speed until the last car starts up. Then the first car moves to catch up with the last car. Details of the experiment Runs are shown in Table 1 in chronological order.</p>
