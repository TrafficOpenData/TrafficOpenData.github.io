## Introduction

<p align="justify">&emsp;The 51 vehicles platoon experiment was carried out on December 15, 2013 on the runway and taxiway of the old airport (which was closed) in Hefei, China. See Fig. 1(a) for the map of the airport. The trajectories of cars measured by the GPS devices installed on each car are shown in Fig. 1(b). One can see that the runway and taxiway are about 3 km long.</p>

<p align="justify">&emsp;High-precision GPS devices were installed on all of the vehicles to record their locations and velocities every 0.1 second. The measurement errors of the GPS devices were within ± 1 m for location and within ± 1 km/h for velocity. Once the experiment starts, the driver of the leading car is required to control the velocity of the car at certain pre-determined constant values. Other drivers in the experiment are required to drive their cars as they normally do, but overtaking is not allowed.
In the experiment, there are 27 GPS devices installed on the leading car and every two cars, i.e., on cars with number 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 43, 46, 47, 50, 51. One can see two typical examples of vehicle trajectory diagrams below.</p>
