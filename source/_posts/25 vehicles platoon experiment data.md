## Introduction

&emsp;The 25 vehicles platoon experiment was carried out on January 19, 2013 on a 3.2 km stretch of the Chuangxin Avenue in a suburban area in Hefei City, China. The experimental section and trajectories of vehicles measured by the GPS devices are shown in Fig. 1. There are no traffic lights on the road section. Since the road is located in a suburban area and has at least three lanes in each direction, there is no interference from other vehicles that are not part of the experiment.

&emsp;High-precision GPS devices were installed on all of the vehicles to record their locations and velocities every 0.1 second. The measurement errors of the GPS devices were within ± 1 m for location and within ± 1 km/h for velocity. Once the experiment starts, the driver of the leading car is required to control the velocity of the car at certain pre-determined constant values. Other drivers in the experiment are required to drive their cars as they normally do, but overtaking is not allowed. 

&emsp;The sequence of vehicle in the platoon and the velocities of leading vehicle in each set are shown in Table 1. Three sets of experiments were carried out under two experimental settings, namely P1, P2 and P3. P1 contains 12 runs of experiments, P2 and P3 contains 23 runs of experiments, respectively. The experimental settings of P2 and P3 are the same. In two of the runs in P2 and P3, the driver of the leading car is required to firstly drive the car at 15 km/h as accurate as he can, then to drive the car without pressing the accelerator pedal (the velocity is about 7 km/h in this case), and then to drive the car at 20 km/h. In other runs, the driver of the leading car is required to accelerate the car to a predetermined velocity and then maintain the car at the constant velocity as accurate as he can. The leading car is equipped with a cruise control system, which could be switched on when its velocity shown by the speedometer reaches 45 km/h. As a result, the fluctuation of the leading car is very small when its velocity is set at a value greater than or equal to 45 km/h. We note that for safety reason, the actual velocity of a car is lower than that shown by the speedometer, in particular when the velocity is high. See Fig. 2 for the velocity of the leading vehicle in all the three sets of experiments. When reaching the end of the road section, the car platoon decelerates, makes U-turn, and stops. When all the cars have stopped, a new run of the experiment begins.

## Excel data description
&emsp;The data in Excel has been arranged in the sequence of vehicles in each run. The data sampling frequency is 10 Hz. Blank data is the missing GPS data. The number in the column name is the number of the GPS device that can be ignored. Each vehicle contains 4 columns of data, and the meaning of each column is shown in Table 2.
